## Eligible next tasks (TODO with no unmet blockers)

- **F-T006** — Postcard editor (6 styles, flip card, orientation toggle, AI generate). Biggest remaining feature.
- **F-T008** — Publish flow (pre-flight, visibility, publish action).
- **F-P003** — PDF export (jspdf). Can start scaffolding.
- **F-P004** — PNG export (html-to-image). Can start scaffolding.
- Dead-code migration Phase 2/3 (housekeeping): subagent is partway through Phase 1 (static-params.ts migrated). Next round: finish migrating `studio-pages.tsx` + `public-pages.tsx` off `DemoStoreProvider`, then delete scaffold providers + lib dupes.

## Active sessions

_none_

## Notes

- Task files exist only for M0 in full detail; M1–M6 have stubs in their milestone READMEs. As M0 completes, expand M1 tasks; as M1 completes, expand M2; etc. This keeps the work-ahead focused and easy to re-prioritise.
- The owner is managing invite codes manually via Supabase Dashboard in beta; no admin UI in scope for M0–M6.

## How to update this file

After claiming or completing a task, adjust the counts and move task lines between sections. Keep the format stable — another agent will parse it.
